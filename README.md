# Querying-a-Large-Relational-Database
This project explores querying and analyzing a large relational database using SQL. The focus is on extracting meaningful insights from the AdventureWorks database, a sample dataset provided by Microsoft. By writing and executing structured queries, the project demonstrates the ability to retrieve customer details, analyze sales trends, and perform specific customer-focused sales analyses.
